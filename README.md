# Papa La Pizza

Papa La Pizza is a cpp / C# project designed to simplify the process of ordering pizzas using OOP principles. It allows users to easily order pizzas by specifying size and toppings. The system also calculates bills for orders and provides a convenient takeaway option.
In addition, it includes an order management system that is only accessible to pizzeria employees.
